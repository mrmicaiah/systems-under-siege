## The Battle Zone

The kitchen drawers. Specifically, the gadget drawer, the utensil drawer, and what I've been calling "the overflow drawer" for three years like that's a normal thing to have.

These drawers haven't been properly organized since we moved in. I've shoved things in, shoved things around, and occasionally rage-slammed them when they wouldn't close. The junk has achieved sentience. It fights back.

Every time I cook, I spend the first five minutes digging through a tangle of whisks, spatulas, and mystery tools I don't remember buying. Last week I cut my finger on something sharp buried under the potato masher. I still don't know what it was.

This is the kitchen equivalent of that closet everyone has. Except I open these drawers multiple times a day and mutter "why do we HAVE this" while searching for a simple measuring spoon.

## Before: The Full Truth

Saturday afternoon. Taco night. I needed to open a can of black beans.

Simple task. Should take four seconds.

I opened the gadget drawer. Dug past the garlic press. Moved the apple corer. Shoved aside something that might be for removing strawberry stems? I've never removed a strawberry stem in my life.

No can opener.

I tried the utensil drawer. Spatulas. Wooden spoons. A meat thermometer I forgot we owned. Something called a "citrus reamer" that Lucas bought during his brief cocktail phase in 2019.

No can opener.

I checked the overflow drawer. And there, buried under a fondue fork set still in the packaging, I found not one can opener, but four.

Four can openers. In the same drawer. That I somehow never saw while looking for a can opener.

I lined them up on the counter and tried each one.

The first one: handle broke off in 2021, apparently. Still in the drawer.

The second one: manual, but the gear is stripped. Spins without gripping.

The third one: electric, except the battery compartment is corroded.

The fourth one: actually works, but the blade is so dull it took me two full minutes to open one can of beans.

That was the moment. Standing in my kitchen, surrounded by four dysfunctional can openers, beans finally open, taco night delayed by ten minutes—that was when I decided the drawers had to go.

## The Great Emptying

Sunday morning. Kids at Grandma's. Coffee in hand. Let's do this.

I pulled everything out of all three drawers and spread it across the kitchen counter and table. 

The count: 47 items total.

Some highlights:

- 6 spatulas (we use 2)
- 4 can openers (0 work well)
- 3 garlic presses (I hate garlic presses)
- 2 avocado tools (one is just a knife with a fancy name)
- 1 corn cob holder set, never opened
- 1 "herb scissors" that cut nothing
- 1 thing I genuinely cannot identify

I stared at this pile of kitchen nonsense and asked myself the only question that matters: What do I actually use?

---

## The Purge

I made three piles:

**Keep:** Things I use at least monthly. Things that work. Things I'd actually look for if they disappeared.

**Donate:** Things that work but I never use. Someone else might want three garlic presses. (Do they? I don't know. I'm donating them anyway.)

**Trash:** Broken things. Mystery things. Things so specialized they've never been used once.

The results:

- Keep: 23 items
- Donate: 14 items  
- Trash: 10 items

I cut my kitchen gadget collection in half in one afternoon.

## The New System

With only 23 items to organize, suddenly I didn't need three drawers.

**Drawer 1: Daily tools**
The things I reach for constantly. Spatulas (2). Wooden spoons (2). Tongs. Whisk. Measuring cups and spoons. The can opener that actually works.

**Drawer 2: Specialty tools**
Things I use sometimes. Meat thermometer. Vegetable peeler. Cheese grater. Ice cream scoop. The stuff that earns its space but doesn't need to be front and center.

The overflow drawer? Empty. I'm using it for dish towels now. Revolutionary.

---

## What I Kept (And Why)

Here's my final 23, for the curious:

1. Silicone spatula (the good one)
2. Flat spatula for flipping
3. Wooden spoon, large
4. Wooden spoon, small
5. Tongs
6. Whisk
7. Measuring cups (nested set)
8. Measuring spoons (on a ring)
9. Can opener (NEW - the old ones are gone)
10. Vegetable peeler
11. Cheese grater (box style)
12. Meat thermometer
13. Kitchen shears
14. Ice cream scoop
15. Ladle
16. Slotted spoon
17. Pasta server
18. Rubber scraper
19. Oven mitts (2)
20. Pot holders (2)
21. Timer
22. Bottle opener
23. Pizza cutter

That's it. Everything I actually need.

## One Week Later

I've been cooking in this kitchen for a week now with 24 fewer gadgets.

You know what I've missed? Nothing.

You know what I've found every single time I've looked for it? Everything.

I open the drawer, I see what I need, I grab it, I cook. No digging. No mystery objects attacking my fingers. No rage-slamming.

This is what a functional kitchen drawer feels like. I'd forgotten.

---

## The Takeaway

We accumulate kitchen gadgets because each one promises to solve a problem. But most of them create new problems instead: drawer chaos, decision fatigue, that vague guilt about unused things.

If you haven't used a kitchen tool in six months, you don't need it. If it's broken, throw it away. If you have multiples, keep the best one.

Your future self, standing at the counter with a can of beans and dinner to make, will thank you.
