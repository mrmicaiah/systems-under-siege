## Hi, I'm Emily.

I'm a graphic designer working from home, a homeschool mom to two kids (Gracie, 9, and Lucas Jr., 7), and the person solely responsible for keeping our 3-bedroom house from complete chaos.

Spoiler: I'm not winning.

But I'm learning. And that's what this blog is about.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a perfect-home, everything-in-its-place kind of blog. If you're looking for that, Pinterest has you covered.

Instead, you'll find:

- **Honest talk about what doesn't work.** I'll tell you about the organizing advice that sounds great but falls apart when you have actual humans living in your house.

- **Specific product recommendations.** When I find something that actually helps, I'll tell you exactly what it is and where I got it.

- **Permission to embrace "good enough."** Sometimes perfect isn't possible. Sometimes the goal is just functional.

## The Battle Continues

Every week, I'm tackling another zone of our house, testing another system, figuring out what works for a family that's home all day, every day.

Some weeks I win. Some weeks the chaos wins. Either way, I'm writing about it.
