    <title>Systems Under Siege: One Woman's Battle for a Clean House</title>
    <link>https://systems-under-siege.untitledpublishers.com/blog/</link>
    <description>Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a graphic designer working from home, a homeschool mom to two kids, and the person solely responsible for keeping our 3-bedroom house from complete chaos. Spoiler: I'm not winning. This blog is where I share what I'm learning—organizing tactics that actually work when you're surrounded by unpredictable, spontaneous people. You'll get honest talk about what doesn't work, specific product recommendations, and permission to embrace &quot;good enough&quot; when perfect isn't possible.</description>
